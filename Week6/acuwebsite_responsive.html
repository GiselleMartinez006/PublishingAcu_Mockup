                <p class="semi-headingdescriptions">Many people often equate the practice of acupuncture with the
                    practice
                    of traditional Chinese medicine. This is not entirely true. While acupuncture is the most often
                    practiced component of traditional Chinese medicine, it is simply that – a component, an important
                    piece
                    of a much larger puzzle. Traditional Chinese medicine encompasses several methods designed to help
                    patients achieve and maintain health. Along with acupuncture, TCM incorporates adjunctive techniques
                    such as cupping, acupressure and moxibustion; manipulative and massage techniques such as tuina and
                    gua
                    sha;
                    herbal medicine; diet and lifestyle changes; meditation; and exercise (often in the form of qigong
                    or
                    tai chi).

                            Acupuncture is a form of alternative medicine and a key component of traditional Chinese
                            medicine (TCM) in which thin needles are inserted into the body. There is a range of
                            acupuncture variants which originated in different philosophies, and techniques vary
                            depending on the country in which it is performed. It is most often used to attempt pain
                            relief, though it is also recommended by acupuncturists for a wide range of other
                            conditions. Acupuncture is safe when done by appropriately trained practitioners using
                            clean
                            needle technique and single-use needles.

                        <p class="semi-headingdescriptions">
                            Moxibustion is a traditional Chinese medicine therapy which consists of burning dried
                            mugwort on particular points on the body. It plays an important role in the traditional
                            medical systems of China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and Mongolia. In traditional Chinese
                            medicine, moxibustion is used on people who have a cold or stagnant condition. The
                            burning
                            of moxa is believed to expel cold and warm the meridians, which leads to smoother flow
                            of
                            blood and qi. In Western medicine, moxibustion has successfully been used to turn breech
                            babies into a normal head-down position prior to childbirth. A landmark study published
                            in
                            the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1998 found that up to 75% of women
                            suffering from breech presentations before childbirth had fetuses that rotated to the
                            normal
                            position after receiving moxibustion at an acupuncture point on the Bladder meridian.
                            Other
                            studies have shown that moxibustion increases the movement of the fetus in pregnant
                            women,
                            and may reduce the symptoms of menstrual cramps when used in conjunction with
                            traditional
                            acupuncture.

                        <p class="semi-headingdescriptions">
                            Cupping is one of the oldest methods of traditional Chinese medicine. In a typical cupping
                            session, glass cups are warmed using a cotton ball or
                            other
                            flammable substance, which is soaked in alcohol, let, then placed inside the cup.
                            Burning a
                            substance inside the cup removes all the oxygen, which creates a vacuum. As the
                            substance
                            burns, the cup is turned upside-down so that the practitioner can place the cup over a
                            specific area. The vacuum created by the lack of oxygen anchors the cup to the skin and
                            pulls it upward on the inside of the glass as the air inside the jar cools. Drawing up
                            the
                            skin is believed to open up the skin’s pores, which helps to stimulate the flow of
                            blood,
                            balances and realigns the flow of qi, breaks up obstructions, and creates an avenue for
                            toxins to be drawn out of the body. Several cups may be placed on a patient’s body at
                            the
                            same time. Sometimes practitioners will also apply small amounts of medicated oils or
                            herbal
                            oils to the skin just before the cupping procedure, which lets them move the cups up and
                            down particular acupoints or meridians after they have been applied.
                            In China, cupping is used primarily to treat respiratory conditions such as bronchitis,
                            asthma, and congestion; arthritis; gastrointestinal disorders; and certain types of
                            pain.
                            Some practitioners also use cupping to treat depression and reduce swelling. Fleshy
                            sites on
                            the body, such as the back and stomach (and, to a lesser extent, the arms and legs), are
                            the
                            preferred sites for treatment.

                                based on concepts in traditional Chinese medicine. In the Japanese language,
                                shiatsu means "finger pressure". Shiatsu techniques include massages with
                                fingers, thumbs, feet and palms; assisted stretching; and joint manipulation and
                                mobilization. To examine a patient, a shiatsu practitioner uses palpation and,
                                sometimes, pulse diagnosis.</p>

                                massage and has been used in China for more than 5,000 years. Practitioners use
                                their finger, hand, elbow, knee or foot to apply pressure to a specific body
                                location which is why it has been defined as “the ancient healing art of fingers

                                massage is typically used for improving blood circulation, inducing relaxation
